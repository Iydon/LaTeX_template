    \question Did you mutter something?
    \begin{solarea}
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore---While I
        nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, As of some
        one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. ``This some
        visitor,'' I muttered, ``tapping at my chamber door---Only this
        and nothing more.''
